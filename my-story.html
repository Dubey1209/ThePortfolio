          <p>You know what?<br>
          I've always been a super curious person — like, always! Even as a kid, whenever something caught my attention, I just had to explore it. Whether it was asking Papa-Mummy endless questions, bothering my grandparents for stories, or trying to figure things out from teachers — I just couldn't sit still until I understood.<br>
          (And no, back then GPT wasn’t around to help... LOL 😅)</p>
          <p>As I grew up, I somehow got drawn toward science — and honestly, it is fascinating!<br>
          That’s how I landed in engineering. And oh boy, engineering opened a whole new world of exciting things.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>🖥️ First Fascination: Websites!</h2>
          <p>I still remember how amazed I was when I realized — wait, I can actually build a website?<br>
          I had zero guidance, no tech mentor, no big sibling in CS — but I was just too curious. So I jumped into frontend development — learned from scratch, messed up a lot, but kept going. Read, built, failed, and repeated — but every little progress made me smile.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>📱 Then Came Android...</h2>
          <p>One random day, I saw a YouTube thumbnail: "Why I Love Android?"<br>
          I clicked it out of curiosity — and… bam! Something clicked inside me too. I started watching more, learning more, and slowly falling in love with Android development.</p>
          <p>No guidance again. Just me, my curiosity, and Kotlin. It was tough. Honestly, I didn’t understand a lot in the beginning. Gradle errors would break me sometimes. But you know that feeling when the app finally builds successfully? That little smile on my face? That peace?<br>
          Yeah, that’s when I knew — I belong here.</p>

        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>🎨 Enter: UI/UX (Accidentally!)</h2>
          <p>One time during a college project, our designer got injured — her hand was fractured. We had a deadline, and the team needed someone to handle the UI. Guess who was handed that role? Me.<br>
          At that time, I had zero clue about design. I started making screens directly in XML on Android Studio. Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing. Screens kept getting discarded, and I felt lost.</p>
          <p>Thankfully, our designer recovered and helped complete the project.<br>
          But something inside me shifted. I didn’t like that I couldn't do it properly — so I decided to learn design.</p>
          <p>And when I actually explored UI/UX, I was like — “Wait... THIS is what design really is?”<br>
          At first, it looked easy. Then it got challenging. And then it got addictive. 😄<br>
          Now? I love it. I keep exploring, designing, and falling deeper into it.</p>

          <h2>🧠 And Then... Product Management?</h2>
          <p>Recently, I came across a LinkedIn post about Product Management — and it clicked again.<br>
          It was like a perfect blend of UI, tech, logic, and a curious mind.<br>
          So of course, my brain went: "WHY NOT EXPLORE THIS TOO?"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>🛣️ But Then, the Pressure...</h2>
          <p>Now that I’m in my 4th year, it’s placement season.<br>
          Companies seem to want people who are masters of one specific domain.<br>
          And that’s where self-doubt crept in. I felt like, "Am I even ready?"<br>
          I mean, I’ve explored a lot — Android, UI/UX, Product, Git/GitHub — but I'm not a pro in one thing.</p>
          <p>And yeah... in all this exploration, DSA sometimes took the back seat.<br>
          Which I regret, honestly — because I genuinely love DSA. It's not just for placements — it’s beautiful.<br>
          Thankfully, I’m back at it now — giving it the time it deserves.</p>

        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>🎢 Juggling Everything...</h2>
          <p>Working on frontend, Android apps, designing UI/UX, learning Product thinking, and doing DSA — it’s not easy.<br>
          But you know what? Curiosity doesn’t let me sit still.<br>
          So I just keep learning, building, breaking, fixing... and learning again.</p>
          <p>I’ve now learned how to prioritize — to make space for all my interests without burning out.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>💡 My Biggest Realization?</h2>
          <p>Despite not being the “top” in any single skill, I’m still happy.<br>
          I’m confident.<br>
          Why?</p>
          <p>Because I never killed my curiosity.<br>
          I never told myself “you can’t do this.”<br>
          Instead, I gave myself the freedom to explore, to try, to fail, to grow.</p>
          <p>And that’s what makes me ME.<br>
          My curiosity.<br>
          My hunger to learn.<br>
          My excitement to try new things.<br>
          My constant journey to improve.</p>

        <div class="my-story-chapter">
          <h2>🚀 And Hey... Isn’t That What Engineers Do?</h2>
          <p>Explore.<br>
          Ask questions.<br>
          Try things.<br>
          Break stuff.<br>
          Fix stuff.<br>
          And of course... code. 😄</p>
          <p>So yes — maybe I’m not a master of one, but I’m a curious, ever-learning, ever-building engineer.<br>
          And I’m super proud of that.</p>
