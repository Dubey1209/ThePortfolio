          <div>You know what?<br>
          That one kid who just couldn't stop asking questions?
Yep — that was me. 😄
Why is the moon following us? What’s inside the TV? Can I build my own robot?
Papa-Mummy were my first search engines. Grandparents? The OG storytellers. And my teachers? Well... let’s just say they earned their salaries 😂

(Also — fun fact: I survived childhood without ChatGPT. I deserve an award for that, right?)

Fast forward a bit — my curiosity met science, and boom!
Engineering happened.
But here's the twist — I didn’t just want to study tech. I wanted to use it to build stuff.
Stuff that makes people’s lives easier. Prettier. Smarter.

That’s how I found myself diving into Android development, sketching UI ideas at 2 AM, exploring product thinking, and yes — breaking things, fixing them, then breaking them again (because, code 😅).

And guess what? Every “wait, how does this work?” turned into a project.
Every “there has to be a better way” became a new idea.
And that’s kind of my thing now — building digital stuff that feels like it just gets the user.</div>
        <div class="my-story-chapter">
         <h2>🖥️ My First Tech Crush: Websites!</h2>
<p>
I still remember the moment it hit me — <i>“Wait... I can actually build a website?!”</i><br>
No tech mentor, no big sibling in CS, not even a clue where to start. Just me, my curiosity, and a bunch of tabs open at once. 😄  
<br><br>
I dove into frontend development headfirst — built my first page, broke it, fixed it, broke it again… but each tiny “It works!” moment felt like magic.  
It wasn’t just code — it was creating something out of nothing. That’s what got me hooked.
<br><br>
And just when I thought things couldn’t get cooler... <b>Android walked into my YouTube recommendations.</b>
</p>
 </div>


        <div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>📱 And Then... Android Happened</h2>
  <p>
    One casual scroll, one random YouTube video: <em>“Why I Love Android?”</em> — I clicked it.  
    Just curiosity at first… but boom — instant connection.  
    Suddenly I was knee-deep in Kotlin tutorials and lowkey arguing with XML like it owed me money. 😅
  </p>
  <p>
    No mentor. No roadmap. Just me vs. Gradle errors (spoiler: Gradle won... often).  
    But that joy when the app *finally* ran? Chef’s kiss. ✨  
    <strong>That’s when I knew — this is my thing.</strong>
  </p>
</div>


       <div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>🎨 UI/UX? Total Accident. Total Obsession.</h2>
  <p>
    During a college project, our designer fractured her hand. Chaos. Deadline. Panic.  
    “Deepika, can you try the UI?” they asked — and just like that, I was handed the wheel… with no map.
  </p>
  <p>
    I opened Android Studio and started designing screens in XML (don’t do that 😅).  
    Most of it was a mess, honestly. But something sparked.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I finally explored what UI/UX *actually* meant, I was hooked.  
    It looked simple… until it wasn’t. And then it became addictive.  
    Now? I’m obsessed with clean, meaningful design — and keep learning with every screen I build.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>🧠 Product Management? That Spark Again!</h2>
  <p>
    One day, I stumbled on a LinkedIn post about Product Management — and boom, it clicked.  
    It felt like everything I loved — design, tech, logic, curiosity — all rolled into one.
  </p>
  <p>
    My brain, obviously: “Okay, this looks fun. Let’s dive in!” 😄  
    And just like that, a new door opened — one that led straight to the heart of building things *that matter*.
  </p>
</div>

        <div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>🛣️ The Pressure Phase (Yep, It Hit Me Too)</h2>
  <p>
    Now that I’m in my final year, the buzzword is “placements.”  
    And suddenly, it feels like everyone wants a specialist — someone who’s *super* into just one thing.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s when the self-doubt crept in: “Wait... I’ve explored Android, UI/UX, Product, Git... but am I *really* great at any one thing?”
  </p>
  <p>
    And yeah — I’ll admit it — DSA sometimes ended up at the bottom of my to-do list.  
    Which I regret. Because honestly? I find DSA beautiful. It’s not just about cracking interviews — it *clicks* with my logical side.
  </p>
  <p>
    So now, I’m back at it — fully committed to mastering it, while still embracing my explorer mindset. :)
  </p>

        <div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>🎢 Juggling It All (And Loving It!)</h2>
  <p>
    Frontend. Android. UI/UX. Product thinking. DSA.<br>
    It’s a lot — and no, it’s not always smooth sailing.
  </p>
  <p>
    But curiosity has this weird grip on me — it never lets me sit still.<br>
    So I keep learning, building, breaking, fixing... and then doing it all over again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, I’ve learned something powerful: <strong>how to prioritize without burning out</strong> — giving space to each passion while still growing every day.
  </p>

       <div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>💡 My Biggest Realization?</h2>
  <p>
    I may not be the “top” in one box — but I’m at peace. And proud.<br>
    Why? Because I never stopped being curious.
  </p>
  <p>
    I didn’t shut doors on myself with “you can’t.”<br>
    I gave myself permission to explore, to fail, to grow — and to come back stronger.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s what makes me, *me* —<br>
    A curious mind, a fast learner, and someone who’s always excited to figure things out.
  </p>
</div>

       <div class="my-story-chapter">
  <h2>🚀 And Hey... Isn’t That What Engineers Do?</h2>
  <p>
    Explore.<br>
    Ask questions.<br>
    Try things.<br>
    Break stuff.<br>
    Fix stuff.<br>
    And yep... code. 😄
  </p>
  <p>
    So maybe I’m not a master of one —<br>
    But I’m a curious, ever-evolving, ever-building engineer.<br>
    And honestly? I’m really proud of that.
